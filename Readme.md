# Understanding patterns or deviations in aeroplane landing profiles with unsupervised learning and ADS-B data

Used Airbus data from Opensky Network: https://opensky-network.org/datasets/states/airbus_tree.csv

Data such as landing angles and airport coordinates can be found from the instrument chart of Hamburg-Finkerwerder Airport.

Used unsupervised learning methods such as kmeans and DBScan [1] to understand any deviations between actual landing profile and target landing profile as stipulated by the instrument chart. 

Project still undergoing.  Feel free to drop some comments!
