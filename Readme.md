# Understanding patterns or deviations landing profiles of aeroplanes with unsupervised learning

Used Airbus data from Opensky Network: https://opensky-network.org/datasets/states/airbus_tree.csv

Data such as landing angles and airport coordinates can be found from the instrument chart of Hamburg-Finkerwerder Airport.

Use unsupervised learning methods such as kmeans and DBScan to understand any deviations between actual landing profile and target landing profile as stipulated by the instrument chart.

Project still undergoing.  Feel free to drop some comments!
